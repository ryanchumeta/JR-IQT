We don't really need a GUI.. but if we have one, here are the features:
1. select recipe
2. run the recipe
2. move the stage
3. get a data point quickly?

this means that the stage and KM tool are initialized at startup.

Do we want DUT control via commands? will need some refactoring
no, just make it part of the recipe

end goal:
able to run calibrations and spit out the data
able to run recipes that show solid colors/gammas and collect at each pupil?

lets first create a recipe that measures XYZ for RGBW at each pupil location
